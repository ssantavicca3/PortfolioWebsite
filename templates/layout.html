<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>My name is Stefan.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Senior Data Analyst within the <a href="https://www.med.emory.edu/">School of Medicine</a> at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Prior to my current role, I served as a Research Associate
   and the Data Compliance Officer for the <a href="https://econ.gatech.edu/HEAL">Health Economics and Analytics Lab</a> within the <a href="https://econ.gatech.edu/">School of Economics</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>I have worked on all aspects of the academic research process, from idea generation to leading journal correspondance during the publication process. I've been lucky to have the
   opportunity to collaborate with and lead teams of researchers from a broad range of backgrounds. E.g., Medical students, residents, post-docs, tenured-track professors, data scientists, departmental vice-chairs, and private industry leaders
   based out of institutions from all over the country, including Emory, Georgia Tech, Virginia, NYU, Washington St. Loius, Harvard, and Stanford.
   To enable academic research, my more technical work-related activities include data mining, data manipulation, data visualization, statistical programming and modeling, and algorithmic problem solving.</p>

<p>I received a BBA in Economics with an emphasis in Consulting and a minor in Statistics from the University of Georgia in 2017 before graduating from Georgia Institute of Technology with an MS in
   Economics in 2019. My portfolio contains a few completed projects I&rsquo;ve led or greatly contributed to.</p>

<!-- <h3> Brief Overview </h3>
<h4> Background </h4>
  <p><strong>History:</strong>
    The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), represents the greatest regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid.
    Apart from the legislation's major provisions and coverage expansions, and alongside other similar pursuits, the ACA established something called the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) as a mechanism to improve
    the state of healthcare delivery and access across the country. The MSSP can be viewed as a sort of rewards (and penalties) program, designed to shift healthcare providers' economic incentives away from volume and
    towards value. In short, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates a individualized cost-per-benficiary benchmark for participating organizations, who are then expected to achieve this benchmark
    by lowering costs without sacrificing care quality. If a participating organization achieves their goal by enough of a margin, they may qualify to <i>share</i> with CMS in the <i>savings</i>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Accountable Care Organizations:</strong>
    To participate in the MSSP, a group of healthcare providers (e.g., hospitals, physician practices, individual providers) must form a legal organization known as an accountable care organization (ACO), under which
    affiliated providers are collectively responsible (i.e., <i>accountable</i>) for the cost and care of their organization's assigned beneficiaries. Historically, ACOs have been led predominately by a hospital system, or a large primary care
    practice. Though there remains debate around the ideal structure of these organizations to optimize program benefits, the data suggest that a focus on integrating a variety of physician specialists can
    improve care coordination by maintaining care continuity across the entire spectrum of their beneficiaries' care pathways.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Radiologists:</strong>
    Many argue that the incentives associated with a traditional fee-for-service reimbursement system have led to the overutilization of MRIs, CT scans, X-rays, etc. As these services are quite expensive,
    radiologists have received criticism for their purported contributions to the balooning healthcare costs in the U.S. However, provided the possibilities for cost reduction and the apparent benefit of
    internalizing radiologists' services alongside those of other specialty care physicians, a question of interest is whether these new value-based organizations have assessed radiologists as an opportunity
    or a liability.
  </p> -->

<h4> Abstract </h4>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    The number and roles of US nonphysician practitioners (NPPs) have expanded considerably, but little is known about their use by radiology practices. The authors assessed characteristics and trends of radiology practices employing Medicare-recognized NPPs.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Methods:</strong>
    Using Medicare databases from 2017 through 2019, the authors mapped all nurse practitioners and physician assistants (together “NPPs”) to employer groups for which all physicians were radiologists (“radiology practices”). Practices were characterized by size, geography, and radiologist characteristics. Temporal changes were assessed, and NPP employment likelihood was estimated using multivariate logistic regression modeling.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Results:</strong>
    As the number of US radiology practices declined by 36.5% (from 2,643 to 1,679) between 2017 and 2019, the number employing NPPs increased by 10.5% (from 228 [8.6%] to 252 [15.0%]). The number of radiologists in NPP-employing practices increased by 10.4% (from 6,596 [35.1%] to 7,282 [40.0%]) as the number of radiology-employed NPPs increased by 17.5% (from 588 to 691). Practices were more likely to employ NPPs when medium (odds ratio [OR], 1.31) or large (OR, 1.25) in size, when urban located (OR, 1.35), and as their percentages of interventional radiologists increased (OR, 5.53 per percentage point) (P < .01 for all). Practices were less likely to employ NPPs as mean radiologist years since completing training increased (OR, 0.99 per year; P < .01).

  <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong>
    Employment of NPPs by radiology practices has grown considerably in recent years, particularly in larger and urban practices and in those that employ more interventional and early-career radiologists. More work is necessary to better understand how this expanding use of NPPs affects the specialty.

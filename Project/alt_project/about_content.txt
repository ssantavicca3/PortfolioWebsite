NOTES:
*****************************************************************
1. Legend
Should I make a legend which lists further acronyms of things
like University at which a class is taken or website/platorm
on which I've taken a course so that I can just list the 
course with an acronym next to it? 

If so, it would be cool to make the legend float and/or follow the user as
he/she scrolls down the page. 

2. Links
Would be nice to provide hyperlinks to whatever I can. Maybe in some
cases have a pop-up show a paragraph or pictures that elaborate/illustrate; this popup should
be able to be hidden/minimized/maximized.
E.g., a certificate, a paragraph to describe the class and what I did, or pictures of
me in Switzerland for iHEA?
